## **_Description_**

This music cataloging website known as "BeatBox" is a website where you can find and organize lots of different music. You can search for artists, albums, and songs, and discover new music that you might like. You can also create playlists, save your favorite songs, and leave reviews for albums.

## **_Getting started_**

Ideally in the future a user will be able to Login/Register on BeatBox to be able to set up a user specific catalog catered to the users taste in music.

In the future this will be deployed online on Heroku [here](link).

A [Trello](https://trello.com/b/LkZT1O4J/music-catalog) board was used to keep track of all progress for this project.
